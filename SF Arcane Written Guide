Note: this is a simplified version of ST and may be old since I wrote this for one youtube commenter. Always trust the sim / AT discord over this:

The opener is Evocation, into missiles, into Arcane Surge and TOTM, then Missiles, Arcane Blast
- After this, use normal rotation

################################################

Intuition 4p Tier change:
When intuition procs, queue barrage after your blast cast, so long as it doesnt waste Burden. If you have NP up double dip with it on the last stack

- Shifting power if you are out of CDs and cooldowns get full CDR from it (12+time spent channeling it)
- Orb if you are less than 2 charges and arcane soul is down
- Barrage after your Blast with burden (queue it), with Glorious Incandescence up (if you didnt do the queue with burden for whatever reason), or for intuition (see above), or if you have 4 charges and TOTM is going to be used.
- Missiles if NP is down, or at 3 stacks of clearcasting. Goal is Missiles and blast blast or blast balast barrage (intuition or burden is up)
- Otherwise arcane blast

Generally I recommend not spending your final clearcasting if missiles is available at 4 Spellfire Spheres. Feels more consistant and makes it always up for 5. Sim doesnt do this and over 10000+ iterations the damage is within .1%. 

If you are 5 Spellfire Spheres
- Use Missiles if you dont have NP, then blast blast barrage
- otherwise Use blast
- DO NOT QUEUE A BARRAGE IF INTUITION PROCS (4p)!

If Burden of Power is up
- Use Missiles if you dont have NP, then blast barrage
- otherwise Use blast barrage

################################################

At the end of Arcane Surge, Arcane Soul procs. With Arcane Soul the goal is to enter with 0 and exit with 3
- AM at 3 clearcasting 
- Use Barrage if below 3 clearcasting
- otherwise Use Barrage
- Always barrage at the end, do this in your last global of Arcane Soul

################################################

Use Shifting Power once your Arcane Soul ends (outside of cooldowns)
- After this, use normal rotation

################################################

Have 4 charges when TOTM is ready
- Use Missiles if you dont have NP, Barrage TOTM
- otherwise Barrage TOTM

################################################

After this touch, you will have a while until CDs.
You will burn a lot of mana. If you dont have enough mana to Blast then Barrage.
- If you are less than 2 arcane charges, use Orb

################################################

Limp to Evocation, then do it all again 
- Try to always have 3 charges going into CDs. Evocation gives 1.
- With 4 charges, we Barrage TOTM 

################################################

Trinket Note: Use spymasters trinket in Execute after Arcane Surge
